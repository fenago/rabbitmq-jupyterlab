Introduction
------------

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes RabbitMQ is
[installed](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) and running on
localhost on standard port (5672). In case you use a different host,
port or credentials, connections settings would require adjusting.

#### Start RabbitMQ Server
Run following command in the terminal to start rabbitmq server:

`service rabbitmq-server start`

`rabbitmqctl status`

#### RabbitMQ UI

Run following command in the terminal one by one to create rabbitmq user and allow UI access:

```
rabbitmqctl add_user fenago fenago

rabbitmqctl set_user_tags fenago administrator

rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / fenago ".*" ".*" ".*"
```


`<host-ip>:<port>:15672`

**Username:** fenago

**Password:** fenago


#### Pre-reqs:
- Google Chrome (Recommended)

#### Lab Environment
All packages have been installed. There is no requirement for any setup.

All Notebooks are present in `work/rabbitmq-jupyterlab` folder.

You can access jupyter lab at `<host-ip>:<port>/lab/workspaces/lab1_java`

**Note:** 
- Terminal is already running. You can also open new terminal by clicking:
`File` > `New` > `Terminal`.
- To copy and paste: use **Control-C** and to paste inside of a terminal, use **Control-V**

Run following command in the terminal and move into java files directory:

`cd /home/jovyan/work/rabbitmq-jupyterlab/java`

RabbitMQ is a message broker: it accepts and forwards messages. You can
think about it as a post office: when you put the mail that you want
posting in a post box, you can be sure that Mr. or Ms. Mailperson will
eventually deliver the mail to your recipient. In this analogy, RabbitMQ
is a post box, a post office and a postman.

The major difference between RabbitMQ and the post office is that it
doesn't deal with paper, instead it accepts, stores and forwards binary
blobs of data â€’ *messages*.

RabbitMQ, and messaging in general, uses some jargon.

-   *Producing* means nothing more than sending. A program that sends
    messages is a *producer* :

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/rabbitmq-jupyterlab/master/images/images_java/producer.webp)

-   *A queue* is the name for a post box which lives inside RabbitMQ.
    Although messages flow through RabbitMQ and your applications, they
    can only be stored inside a *queue*. A *queue* is only bound by the
    host's memory & disk limits, it's essentially a large message
    buffer. Many *producers* can send messages that go to one queue, and
    many *consumers* can try to receive data from one *queue*. This is
    how we represent a queue:

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/rabbitmq-jupyterlab/master/images/images_java/queue.webp)

-   *Consuming* has a similar meaning to receiving. A *consumer* is a
    program that mostly waits to receive messages:

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/rabbitmq-jupyterlab/master/images/images_java/consumer.webp)

Note that the producer, consumer, and broker do not have to reside on
the same host; indeed in most applications they don't. An application
can be both a producer and consumer, too.

"Hello World"
-------------

### (using the Java Client)

In this part of the tutorial we'll write two programs in Java; a
producer that sends a single message, and a consumer that receives
messages and prints them out. We'll gloss over some of the detail in the
Java API, concentrating on this very simple thing just to get started.
It's a "Hello World" of messaging.

In the diagram below, "P" is our producer and "C" is our consumer. The
box in the middle is a queue - a message buffer that RabbitMQ keeps on
behalf of the consumer.

> #### The Java client library

> RabbitMQ speaks multiple protocols. This tutorial uses AMQP 0-9-1,
> which is an open, general-purpose protocol for messaging. There are a
> number of clients for RabbitMQ in [many different
> languages](https://rabbitmq.com/devtools.html). We'll use the Java
> client provided by RabbitMQ.
>
> Download the [client
> library](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/rabbitmq/amqp-client/5.7.1/amqp-client-5.7.1.jar)
> and its dependencies ([SLF4J
> API](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/slf4j/slf4j-api/1.7.26/slf4j-api-1.7.26.jar)
> and [SLF4J
> Simple](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/slf4j/slf4j-simple/1.7.26/slf4j-simple-1.7.26.jar)).
> Copy those files in your working directory, along the tutorials Java
> files.
>
> Please note SLF4J Simple is enough for tutorials but you should use a
> full-blown logging library like [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) in
> production.

> (The RabbitMQ Java client is also in the central Maven repository,
> with the groupId com.rabbitmq and the artifactId amqp-client.)

Now we have the Java client and its dependencies, we can write some
code.

### Sending

![(P) -\> [|||]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/rabbitmq-jupyterlab/master/images/images_java/sending.webp)

We'll call our message publisher (sender) Send and our message consumer
(receiver) Recv. The publisher will connect to RabbitMQ, send a single
message, then exit.

In
[Send.java](https://github.com/fenago/rabbitmq-jupyterlab/blob/master/java/Send.java),
we need some classes imported:

``` {.lang-java .hljs}
import com.rabbitmq.client.ConnectionFactory;
import com.rabbitmq.client.Connection;
import com.rabbitmq.client.Channel;
```

Set up the class and name the queue:

``` {.lang-java .hljs}
public class Send {
  private final static String QUEUE_NAME = "hello";
  public static void main(String[] argv) throws Exception {
      ...
  }
}    
```

then we can create a connection to the server:

``` {.lang-java .hljs}
ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
factory.setHost("localhost");
try (Connection connection = factory.newConnection();
     Channel channel = connection.createChannel()) {

}
```

The connection abstracts the socket connection, and takes care of
protocol version negotiation and authentication and so on for us. Here
we connect to a RabbitMQ node on the local machine - hence the
*localhost*. If we wanted to connect to a node on a different machine
we'd simply specify its hostname or IP address here.

Next we create a channel, which is where most of the API for getting
things done resides. Note we can use a try-with-resources statement
because both Connection and Channel implement java.io.Closeable. This
way we don't need to close them explicitly in our code.

To send, we must declare a queue for us to send to; then we can publish
a message to the queue, all of this in the try-with-resources statement:

``` {.lang-java .hljs}
channel.queueDeclare(QUEUE_NAME, false, false, false, null);
String message = "Hello World!";
channel.basicPublish("", QUEUE_NAME, null, message.getBytes());
System.out.println(" [x] Sent '" + message + "'");
```

Declaring a queue is idempotent - it will only be created if it doesn't
exist already. The message content is a byte array, so you can encode
whatever you like there.

[Here's the whole Send.java
class](https://github.com/fenago/rabbitmq-jupyterlab/blob/master/java/Send.java).

> #### Sending doesn't work!
>
> If this is your first time using RabbitMQ and you don't see the "Sent"
> message then you may be left scratching your head wondering what could
> be wrong. Maybe the broker was started without enough free disk space
> (by default it needs at least 200 MB free) and is therefore refusing
> to accept messages. Check the broker logfile to confirm and reduce the
> limit if necessary. The [configuration file
> documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html#config-items)
> will show you how to set disk\_free\_limit.

### Receiving

That's it for our publisher. Our consumer listens for messages from
RabbitMQ, so unlike the publisher which publishes a single message,
we'll keep the consumer running to listen for messages and print them
out.

![[|||] -\> (C)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/rabbitmq-jupyterlab/master/images/images_java/receiving.webp)

The code (in
[Recv.java](https://github.com/fenago/rabbitmq-jupyterlab/blob/master/java/Recv.java))
has almost the same imports as Send:

``` {.lang-java .hljs}
import com.rabbitmq.client.Channel;
import com.rabbitmq.client.Connection;
import com.rabbitmq.client.ConnectionFactory;
import com.rabbitmq.client.DeliverCallback;
```

The extra DeliverCallback interface we'll use to buffer the messages
pushed to us by the server.

Setting up is the same as the publisher; we open a connection and a
channel, and declare the queue from which we're going to consume. Note
this matches up with the queue that send publishes to.

``` {.lang-java .hljs}
public class Recv {

  private final static String QUEUE_NAME = "hello";

  public static void main(String[] argv) throws Exception {
    ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
    factory.setHost("localhost");
    Connection connection = factory.newConnection();
    Channel channel = connection.createChannel();

    channel.queueDeclare(QUEUE_NAME, false, false, false, null);
    System.out.println(" [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C");

  }
}
```

Note that we declare the queue here, as well. Because we might start the
consumer before the publisher, we want to make sure the queue exists
before we try to consume messages from it.

Why don't we use a try-with-resource statement to automatically close
the channel and the connection? By doing so we would simply make the
program move on, close everything, and exit! This would be awkward
because we want the process to stay alive while the consumer is
listening asynchronously for messages to arrive.

We're about to tell the server to deliver us the messages from the
queue. Since it will push us messages asynchronously, we provide a
callback in the form of an object that will buffer the messages until
we're ready to use them. That is what a DeliverCallback subclass does.

``` {.lang-java .hljs}
DeliverCallback deliverCallback = (consumerTag, delivery) -> {
    String message = new String(delivery.getBody(), "UTF-8");
    System.out.println(" [x] Received '" + message + "'");
};
channel.basicConsume(QUEUE_NAME, true, deliverCallback, consumerTag -> { });
```

[Here's the whole Recv.java
class](https://github.com/fenago/rabbitmq-jupyterlab/blob/master/java/Recv.java).

### Putting it all together

You can compile both of these with just the RabbitMQ java client on the
classpath:

``` {.lang-bash .hljs}
javac -cp amqp-client-5.7.1.jar Send.java Recv.java
```

To run them, you'll need rabbitmq-client.jar and its dependencies on the
classpath. In a terminal, run the consumer (receiver):

``` {.lang-bash .hljs}
java -cp .:amqp-client-5.7.1.jar:slf4j-api-1.7.26.jar:slf4j-simple-1.7.26.jar Recv
```

then, run the publisher (sender):

``` {.lang-bash .hljs}
java -cp .:amqp-client-5.7.1.jar:slf4j-api-1.7.26.jar:slf4j-simple-1.7.26.jar Send
```

On Windows, use a semicolon instead of a colon to separate items in the
classpath.

The consumer will print the message it gets from the publisher via
RabbitMQ. The consumer will keep running, waiting for messages (Use
Ctrl-C to stop it), so try running the publisher from another terminal.

> #### Listing queues
>
> You may wish to see what queues RabbitMQ has and how many messages are
> in them. You can do it (as a privileged user) using the rabbitmqctl
> tool:
>
> ``` {.lang-bash .hljs}
> sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues
> ```
>
> On Windows, omit the sudo:
>
> ``` {.lang-powershell .hljs}
> rabbitmqctl.bat list_queues
> ```
>
Time to move on to part 2 and build a simple *work queue*.

> #### Hint
>
> To save typing, you can set an environment variable for the classpath
> e.g.
>
> ``` {.lang-bash .hljs}
> export CP=.:amqp-client-5.7.1.jar:slf4j-api-1.7.26.jar:slf4j-simple-1.7.26.jar
> java -cp $CP Send
> ```
>
> or on Windows:
>
> ``` {.lang-powershell .hljs}
> set CP=.;amqp-client-5.7.1.jar;slf4j-api-1.7.26.jar;slf4j-simple-1.7.26.jar
> java -cp %CP% Send
> ```
